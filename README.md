# Resource Allocation Graph Simulator with Deadlock detection

1. Project Overview
Goal
Develop a graphical simulation tool for visualising Resource Allocation Graphs (RAGs) and analysing deadlock scenarios interactively. The tool will allow users to create, modify, and test various resource allocation conditions in a dynamic environment.
Expected Outcomes
â€¢	Graphical Representation of processes and resources in a Resource Allocation Graph (RAG).
â€¢	Real-time Deadlock Detection through cycle identification in the graph.
â€¢	Interactive Simulation where users can allocate and release resources dynamically.
â€¢	Visual Indicators (colour coding and animations) to highlight deadlocks and safe states.
â€¢	Step-by-Step Deadlock Analysis, allowing users to test different resource management strategies.


Scope
â€¢	Useful for students and professionals studying Operating Systems.
â€¢	Provides an interactive and educational experience for understanding deadlock conditions.
â€¢	Supports custom inputs for resource allocation and demand.
â€¢	Can be used for teaching and debugging real-world deadlock scenarios.
